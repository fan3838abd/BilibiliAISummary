1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,287
Chinese fans gave it love,

2
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:02,993
North American viewers panned it hard;

3
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:04,654
critics praised it while roasting it,

4
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:06,899
most said it was decent but just lacked that spark.

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,700
Why has 'Zootopia 2' drawn such polarized audience reviews?

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,553
because 'Zootopia' is a film about America,

7
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:13,545
and today's U.S.

8
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,588
is no longer the one that moves us so easily —

9
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:17,759
hello, I'm backlash

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,051
I saw 'Zootopia 2' the other day,

11
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,383
of course in the original version.

12
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:22,750
While its script pales next to the first film's brilliance,

13
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,179
it still deserves a recommendation.

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,288
it is a film that lets you enjoy a pleasant time

15
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:27,300
right there in the cinema.

16
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,910
smooth pacing, tight jokes,

17
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,438
and tech that soars beyond limits—
you can glimps

18
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,212
se the golden-er

19
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:33,280
ra Disney in its spiri

20
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,326
given Disney's track record in recent years,

21
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,375
this film is already a stellar effort—what more

22
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,160
could you ask for?

23
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,930
so I recommend you watch 'Zootopia 2' in the cinemas.

24
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,137


25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,334
the original 'Zootopia' was packed with metaphors,

26
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:52,559
using a simple fairy tale

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,060
to explore racial tensions within American society.

28
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,062
it also poked fun at many modern-day woes,

29
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:59,340
which earned the film tremendous praise from viewers.

30
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,461
This time Disney stuck to the series' style

31
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,060
and packed the film with many metaphors about U.S. society

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,760
but the US changed so swiftly over these past ten years

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,911
these metaphors felt like US-

34
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:10,132
-only Lovecraftian stuff—Chinese folks couldn't parse them,

35
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,740
and Americans wished they couldn't either.

36
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,243
Zootopia 1 also unpacks much of American society,

37
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:16,133
yet its surface tale is very universal —

38
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,820
a country girl moving to the city to chase her dreams.

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,603
when we see Judy's excitement as she enters the big city,

40
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:24,140
and her video calls with family in a noisy rental flat

41
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,791
seeing her flustered by her parents' nagging yet faking

42
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:27,853
that she's doing fine,

43
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,299
we can easily empathize with this plucky little bunny.

44
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,040
and the second film is just way too America-centric

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,323
big money rigging votes,

46
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,619
Native Americans evicted — I must clear my name,

47
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,573
patent wars, and even group-therapy chats —

48
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:39,599
all so very American.

49
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,320
this means Chinese viewers can grasp

50
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,505
what they're talking about,

51
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:44,700
yet feel no connection to the themes they explore.

52
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,780
just laugh at memes and Nick & Judy ship, nothing more to it

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,850
but if you see Zootopia through an American viewer's lens,

54
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,800
it feels like hell.

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,185
In Zootopia, elections are rigged,

56
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:55,202
and the mayor is just a pawn of the moneyed clans.

57
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,862
Mayor Winddancer, the city's official ruler,

58
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,919
is a golden retriever with a flair for the dramatic.

59
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,616
in the underworld, there's Big Boss,

60
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,447
a mob don who might toss you in the trunk

61
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,654
and kill you—snap his face,

62
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,460
and your camera gets smashed on the spot.

63
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,918
and this mob boss could still attend elite soirees

64
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:08,939
in a respectable guise.

65
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,410
The Lin Shixiang Family is a textbook deep state —

66
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,170
respected and reputable in public view

67
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,422
as top-tier entrepreneurs,

68
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:17,069
yet behind the scenes they summon the mayor to give orders.

69
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,691
back then folks just laughed off such claims as conspiracy,

70
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:22,122
but after Donald Trump and Sleepy Joe kept stirring the pot,

71
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:24,100
now many find it hard to deny such things exist

72
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,044
just pull out one of their younger sons,

73
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,655
and they could run a smuggling route

74
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,760
to ship catnip into town for human trafficking.

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,921
most creatures in the city

76
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,886
are stuck screwing bolts on assembly lines;

77
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,030
in the last film, Fox Nick, who roamed the streets,

78
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,549
was seen as Zootopia's underclass.

79
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,788
this one tells you straight:

80
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,112
there are slums at the city fringe

81
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,710
that the mainstream won't even glance at

82
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,531
these slums are set to be torn down due to city plans,

83
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,840
yet the locals have no say in the matter at all

84
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,446
just these themes—when American viewers see them,

85
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:49,700
they likely won't smile,

86
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,204
for while we talk of metaphors,

87
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,010
they are living the metaphor itself

88
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,522
America is indeed a salad—many ethnic groups

89
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:56,970
tossed together in one bowl

90
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,380
when wolves and sheep clash, we just think of Pleasant Goat

91
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,340
which grating neighbor they might think of is anyone's guess

92
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,825
and after laying out so many conflicts and issues

93
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,912
that American viewers could truly relate to,

94
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,320
the show's final solution is...

95
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,014
if everyone has a heart of tolerance

96
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:11,387
and accepts that others differ,

97
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:12,140
all will be fine

98
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,620
such folks. The theme of mental illness.

99
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,460
Chinese viewers find this easier to take.

100
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,909
because for years we've watched American films

101
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,000
that all push the same open-minded values

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,201
if you dare say it,

103
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:26,760
I'll believe—just treat it as a tale of light

104
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,041
but in today's US,

105
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,926
where the poor must borrow to buy lunch,

106
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:32,000
and churches hang up when asked for formula

107
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,279
in Seattle's icy nights,

108
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,568
telling Americans about openness and tolerance,

109
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:37,495
about embracing what's different—sounds

110
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,880
a bit smug and out of touch

111
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,388
this is like being dragged by four men deep into Amazon,

112
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,040
into a cave where no satellites reach

113
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,087
you frantically activate the life-saving tool

114
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:45,866
your dad left you,

115
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,900
then lights flash—four words appear in the sky

116
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,280
Believe in self—none stay unshaken?

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,181
because it's far, and we can't feel it firsthand,

118
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:54,995
we can instead enjoy more purely

119
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,640
the joyous bits in 'Zootopia 2'.

120
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,693
at best one might feel

121
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,480
this fell just a tad short of striking chords

122
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,908
but we still believe

123
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,840
that fairy tale world Disney painted for us truly exists.

124
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,320
but when Chinese viewers check if Fox and Bunny are OOC

125
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,541
what U.S. viewers see is the slums near their own homes

126
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,612
that have never been truly resolved —

127
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:15,619
the 'reptiles' slums.

128
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,786
they made their own tragedy,

129
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:21,560
while we saw it as a poorly received comedy by chance

130
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,984
If we dig deeper,

131
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:25,240
Zootopia 2 still holds many intriguing elements.

132
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,228
which real-world group the reptiles symbolize

133
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,840
is a topic many have debated fiercely.

134
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,593
The first guess is Native Americans,

135
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,273
since the film nods to 'The Shining,'

136
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,532
where beneath the hotel lay

137
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,399
where Native Americans were slaughtered.

138
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,080
and beneath Lin Shixiang Manor lies the reptiles' birthplace

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,558
drive Native Americans out and build estates on their land —

140
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:43,039
a very American move indeed

141
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,625
the second pick is Latino,

142
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,656
since reptiles have many Latin traits,

143
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,823
and their plight mirrors Mexican workers

144
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,450
amid U.S. immigration tensions

145
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,449
Many folks don't know

146
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,230
that the US didn't start with its current shape.

147
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,165
the American West,

148
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:56,430
all of California, was once Mexican territory

149
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,208
the US invaded Mexico and seized the whole West Coast,

150
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,540
thus becoming a superpower spanning two oceans.

151
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,993
Mexicans had to hide in jungles to survive;

152
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,001
now when they sneak back into the U.S.,

153
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,324
they're called dangerous

154
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,529
undocumented migrants and told to leave.

155
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,408
the snake clan's tale in the film

156
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,740
mirrors it—nine or ten parts alike, at least.

157
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,911
the second candidate is overly smug—he is Gary's ancestor

158
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,840
who laid the groundwork for Zootopia,

159
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,300
yet is now seen as a threat.

160
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,128
and Gary is voiced by ethnic Chinese,

161
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,740
which evokes Chinese laborers and the Pacific Railroad

162
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,721
the Chinese laborers built the lifeline

163
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,292
linking East and West for the US,

164
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,647
yet no Chinese faces appear in the Pacific Railroad

165
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:31,479
completion photos.

166
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,281
they laid the groundwork for America,

167
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:34,695
yet faced slurs and hostility;

168
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,108
they were herded into Chinatown,

169
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:37,866
subjected to the Chinese Exclusion Act,

170
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,209
and branded the Yellow Peril.

171
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,410
now, their kin are once more painted as foes of the world

172
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,094
if it weren't for Hollywood,

173
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,943
they'd likely ignore Chinese voices—

174
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,370
I'd vote for that scenario.

175
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,893
One image yields three archetypes—indeed,

176
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:52,006
America has inherited UK's proud legacy

177
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:53,380
of great virtue and flaws.

178
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,520
but I can see a fourth possibility

179
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,849
here—one far more perilous—do you recall

180
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,212
what led the main group

181
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:01,030
to Grandma Garry's old hometown?

182
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,098
a beacon, buried in snow,

183
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:05,719
the last glimmer of light that beacon held.

184
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,276
In 1991, George H. W. Bush gave a speech

185
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:11,870
declaring the United States to be the 'Lighthouse Nation.'

186
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,888
in Zootopia 2, the big capital clans buried this original land

187
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,340
and the beacon that once lit the world.

188
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,325
they hunted beacon's descendants,

189
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,366
used cash and spin to hide the truth,

190
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,155
and kept expanding their domains,

191
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:26,450
burying more free lands beneath the snow

192
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,980
Animals with territorial drives

193
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,844
can't resist the urge to expand—does this refer to lynxes

194
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:33,590
or capital?

195
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,505
the beacon in the film, with its last faint glow,

196
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,110
led its descendants home once more

197
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,230
Does the beacon in truth still cast that faint light?

198
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,046
So why is the reception of 'Zootopia 2' so polarized?

199
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:47,114
The divide lies not in the film itself,

200
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,019
but in the world beyond the screen.

201
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,650
We still watch plays, but they have long lived in the script.

202
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,005
Thanks for watching, I'm backlash —

203
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,492
a cheerful rogue who sees only subjectivity, no objectivity.
